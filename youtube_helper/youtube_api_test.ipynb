For example, The iPad could take the place of Tesla’s touchscreen and now with Mag safe could possibly add an extra layer of security by being able to take the iPad with you and activating or deactivating the car. I’d love my model Y touchscreen to have been a little bit closer to me in an encased center console type of set up where through Mag safe I could use and swap in and out my iPad.

The biggest trend in the world is the dematerialization of everything.  Netflix dematerialized movies, Google dematerialized the library,  BitCoin is dematerializing gold, cloud computing is dematerializing computing, Amazon dematerialized retail, and on and on and on.  Tesla is working on dematerializing transportation.  That's the real play.   Apple's problem is that Tesla is SERIOUSLY far ahead, and they haven't even gotten started.  \\n\\nApple's primary business model, the only one they have been able to really make work for them, is luxury consumer retail.  They've had mostly bad luck with their services, the services which have been successful have been successful because of their home field dominance within Apple's hardware ecosystem, not that they beat out other best of breed options on equal footing.  Apple is going to want to sell every car at a profit, and how long is it going to take Apple to carve out a name for themselves in EVs, get their costs down, get their production ramped up, and have a meaningful number of cars on the road where they can start solving autonomy?  And *IF* they do manage to solve autonomy, are they going to be able to compete with Tesla as a service, where the customer doesn't own the underlying hardware?  (App Store wins because the customer has an iPhone, but that's not the game here.)\\n\\nCompare that with Tesla who is going to double the number of Teslas on the road next year, where they already almost have FSD solved.  Let's say Apple can really leverage themselves into this space, and they some how manage to ramp themselves into selling 500k EVs a year by 2025 with about 1M cars on the road (that would be WAY faster than Tesla pulled it off), but Tesla will be selling something like 7.5M cars in 2025 and will have 13M cars on the road, all of which fully autonomous.   At that point Tesla is in a race to build the largest most robust autonomous network on earth.  While at the same time Apple is still trying to boot strap the tools they need to try to have the software they need to do the same.  Fast forward another 5 years, Tesla is THE autonomous network, and Apple left the business as autonomy crushed consumer demand for cars, and Apple didn't have their own network ready.\", 'Elon responed to Dave Lee.

Today, there is more at stake than competing car companies.  There is the tech side and Tesla currently is VHS in this scenario.  Everything else is BETA trying to find a niche in the market.  FSD, the ability to fast charge and the network to do it are the characteristics that will define the STANDARDS in the industry.  So far, TESLA seems to be dragging ALL the competitors in it’s wake.

Elon builds cars that only the wealthy can afford and, though it's believed that tax payer money was payed back with interest, there is no proof. In the meantime Tesla benefitted from corporate welfare. Like Apple and Nike, Tesla branched into China, which cost American jobs but shored up Tesla's profits by employing cheap labor. The stock market responded positively. So while investors and Wall Street continues to profit, the people on main street suffer. Tesla isn't a unique story. This is how America does business. It stuns me that U.S. corporations and our government willingly turns a blind eye to China's concentration camps and the genocide against the Uighur people. If genocide were to happen in Western Europe the forces of the United Nations would be rallied but because China conceals their atrocities it is out of sight, out of mind. America needs to put our country first. We need to put our people and our jobs first rather than allow unfettered greed to run rampant at the expense of our own people. We must not be culpable in China's atrocities against the Uighurs. This pandemic highlighted how much America depends on China, whether it be for pharmaceuticals, ventilators, or personal protection equipment, it's clear that allowing American companies free rein to seek cheap labor oversees is a national security risk.

Beobachter erwarten, dass in dem skandinavischen Land schon 2025 keine reinen Verbrennerautos mehr zugelassen werden.\\n\\nZum Vergleich: Deutschland holt bei den E-Autos zwar kräftig auf, doch lag\\xa0der Anteil von Batterieautos bei den Neuzulassungen im September lediglich bei acht Prozent, Plug-in-Hybride machten weitere 7,6 Prozent aus. Norwegen hat nur rund 5,3 Millionen Einwohner, der Automarkt ist entsprechend klein. Und doch beobachten ihn aufgrund seiner Vorreiterfunktion Menschen in aller Welt.\\n\\nDer Audi E-tron und VW ID.3 überzeugen in Norwegen – und übertrumpfen Tesla\\n\\n2019 war Teslas Model 3 mit 15.683 Fahrzeugen das meistverkaufte neue Auto in Norwegen. Doch in diesem Jahr stürzen wohl die deutschen Autohersteller den kalifornischen Elektro-Pionier vom Thron. Denn bis Ende September 2020 konnte Tesla nur 3.197 Neuwagen seines Model 3 verkaufen – nicht mal halb so viele wie Audi mit seinem Elektro-SUV, dem E-tron (7.690 Autos). Das geht aus den\\xa0Daten der norwegischen Verkehrsbehörde OFV\\xa0hervor.\\n\\nLEST AUCH\\n\\n￼￼\\n\\nVW kommt mit blauem Auge durch die Corona-Krise. Nun beginnt der radikale Wandel zum Konzern für E-Autos „mit Gehirn“\\n\\nZwischen 2008 und 2017 – also bis zur norwegischen Mobilitätswende – war der\\xa0VW Golf das meistverkaufte Auto in Norwegen. Nun ist Volkswagen offenbar auf dem Sprung, sich den Platz wieder zu erkämpfen – mit seinem\\xa0elektrischen Hoffnungsträger, dem ID.3.\\n\\nDer ID.3 hat in Norwegen einen rasanten Start hingelegt: Nach seiner Markteinführung setzte Volkswagen von ihm im September 1.989 Modelle ab. Vom Tesla Model 3 wurden im selben Monat nur 1.116 Neuwagen zugelassen. Volkswagens ID.3 war damit gleichzeitig in Norwegen das meistverkaufte Auto im September. Auf die weitere Entwicklung ist man nicht nur in Wolfsburg gespannt.\\n\\nhttps://www.power-technology.com/features/hotter-than-the-sun-iter-and-the-pursuit-of-nuclear-fusion/\\n\\n\\n\\nNo material can resist long time against heat of hot fusion plasma also ITER only 7-8 minutes.

We handicap our students who go into any endeavor because they have to learn 2 systems of measurement or worse how to convert between the two.  This is just insanity.   Another example: Using 110 volt wiring in our houses instead of 220 volts.  Our plugs are really dangerous compared to those in the EU which are insulated until they are plugged in beyond the point being able to be touched.  The other really huge concern is the amp draw which is halved when you use 220 volts.This means smaller wires, circuit breakers, and load centers are needed.  Smaller guage wires mean money saved as well as copper resources.  For instance a 30 amp 110 volt load requires a #8 wire, the same load on 220 volts would equate to 15 amps and a #10 wire is required (this is just for a 15 foot distance for comparison purposes). At the local big box hardware store, #8 is 99 cents/ft and #10 is 75 cents/foot.  This is a 31% cost savings and just think how many wires run in a normal house.', \"Great chemistry with Elon & Drew.

Some YouTube channels and news reports ignored these points that were raised. \\nStock holders proposals, these are points that stock holders want Tesla to address. Tesla was opposed to all of the following proposals. Which was very Donald Trump, AKA dictatorship like in their thinking, in my opinion.\\nThe first Stock holder proposal came from Mr McRichy.\\nComplaints were as follows..\\n1. Board members can only be removed if involved in criminal activity.\\n2. Individual directors can only be held accountable every three years!\\n3. The democratic way of voting must not be involved in the corporate governance of decision because as it stands, 33% of votes can win against 67% of opposition.\\nStock holder Dr Kelly Hall\\nAddressed the lack of arbitration in Tesla, in other words employees do not have the right to complain about the following.\\n1. Discrimination / race and gender\\n2. Harassment \\nShe further states that Tesla are working unlawfully and against the civil rights act of 1964.\\nShe further names the Buffalo and Freemont plants as being the worst offenders.\\nStock holder Mr Terrence Colinsworth \\nStated the following objections \\nRegarding human rights disclosure.\\nHe states five current violations of human rights.\\n1. Racism sexual harassment \\n2. Covid 19 protection is not only notvbeing addressed, but workers are facing retaliation from management when they ask for adequate protection.\\n3. Serious and deadly issues on in Tesla,s global supply chains.\\n4. Terry staes his organisation is currently  bringing a law suit against Tesla for mining Colbolt mining in the democratic Republic of Congofor using child labour, Terry further states that he had met the children that were mining there, these boys had lost arms and legs during mine shaft collapses.\\nThis goes against Teslas code of conduct. Tesla is not only tolerating child labour in its Coblot supply chain but is tolerating the death and maiming of young child miners, this demonstrates why the company must circle back and begin a process to report on its treatment of human rights issues as requested in this proposal.\\nEssentially Terry is asking for Teslar to do as they said they would in their human rights disclosure documents, which Tesla have not only written a false statement, but lied to their clients and share holders.\\nMy point is if Tesla have lied about this then who knows what else they have lied about. This to me undermines the good work that some the employees and management have done, it further undermines and makes fools of its client base, and shareholders. \\nI am disappointed that these stock holder felt the need to have these points addressed at all, and for me these points dominated the whole event!

A lot cities across the world still get their electricity from a dirty source adding to the carbon footprint of your EV. The average carbon footprint for manufacturing an EV on average adds ONE TON of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere which is twice as much as the average production of a gas vehicle. The average carbon footprint of an EV is, on average, 50% of that of a gas car over the life span of those two cars. But the average lifespan of an EV is 10 years where as a gas cars life span can be MUCH longer than that for even less cost than replacing a battery on your tesla or prius. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe real problem is people commuting to work for a job where they do not have to be in an office.

The great tribulation is about to begin, the worst time this world will ever know. God the Father wants to have a relationship with His creation. But everyone is born into sin and we need a way for us to be able to live eternally with the Father in heaven. Jesus made that way. Even though He is God, He left heaven and came to earth to be a sacrifice for a lost world. He never sinned. He was abandoned by His friends, was betrayed by Judas and handed over to be crucified. He was beaten so badly that He could not be recognized as a man. Then He willingly suffered an agonizing drawn out death on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised Him from the dead. And now He sits at the right hand of the Father and He is coming back any day now to Take home those who belong to Him. Just believe that He died for your sins. \\nYou don't have to repent of sins. People who teach that, are wrong and they are not saved.\\xa0 You don't have to give up drinking or drugs, etc. Just have faith that Jesus fully paid the price.\\nAfter you are saved rest in Jesus' sacrifice. God will guide you and help you get rid of bad habits and to do good works according to His will. If you think you should do works, you're saying Jesus' sacrifice was not enough. Faith plus works will NOT save you. Once you believe that Jesus died for your sins, you will receive the Holy Spirit and you are sealed for eternity. Nothing you do or don't do can cause you to lose your salvation. Those who say that you can lose it are not saved. There is nothing we can do! It's all about what Jesus did! God gave us free will but He is a just God.\\xa0 Rejecting salvation means an agonizing eternity in hell! In the great tribulation, the age of grace will be over and to be saved you must believe on Jesus plus resist taking the mark of the beast. Believe on Jesus now and you will escape having to go through the great tribulation!\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

Ephesians 2:8-9 (KJV) 8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. So it's only by GRACE that we are saved not by works. Jesus did all the work and gave us GRACE (unmerited favor) as long as we have FAITH (believe) in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ for SALVATION (trust in his blood).

Many people can't afford both a vehicle and stationary battery storage for their homes. Many people must own a car for practical purposes and therefore VTG gives them the ability to store emergency power. By enabling VTG you are democratizing the security and convenience of stable power in uncertain times. Even the smallest battery on the model 3 is over 60kwh if I'm not mistaken. A powerwall is around 8kwh or so. Even if people have to buy additional hardware to use VTG that means they might only be purchasing something for 1,000 dollars or so instead of several thousand dollars. On to the cybertruck, that will likely have a battery over 120kwh! Do you know how expensive stationary storage of that magnitude is? VTG is needed.\", 'I do not owe anybody anything now thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*', 'Inspiring presentation.

Since there wasn't enough shares to satisfy the indexers demand, I'm guessing there was a push to acquire shares rapidly by hedge funds, etc. so they could satisfy the indexers need.  That immediate need will not exist on Monday IF the indexers were satisfied.  That would leave me to believe it will be down next week.\\n\\nThe other factor is benchmarkers.  Apparently (not sure) they don't have much exposure to Tesla but will likely add some by year end.  I don't think they will rush to buy and will be more opportunistic.  Also, there are macro factors that affect Tesla so a positive S&P/Nasdaq, positive stimulus news etc. could lend support to the stock.  But it is my opinion that the stock will be down by year end even with upcoming positive news leaks on deliveries and Model Y China.  Positive delivery numbers ~180k may actually be a sell the news event for a few weeks.\\n\\nComplete guess but I'm positioned for high $570 - $630, leaning more towards the lower end of that range.

Attack when the enemy is exposed.\\r\\nIn hindsight, this is evident in the nosediving trading curve in the final hour of trading as the 5-minute (closing-cross for indexing) trading window approached, followed by the unprecedent spike at the close of trading. \\r\\nThis was a result of the no trading action by the major fund managers / market movers (throughout most of the hour) - an intentional strategy to remove the anticipated buying pressure from the market dynamic and engineer speculator and stockholder anxiety... to encourage last-opportunity profit taking and a race to sell before too late.\\r\\nThe second phase of the strategy was the fund managers jumping out from the shadows and instantaneously buying tens of millions of shares (69 million?) the moment before close (after the price compression), that dramatically bumped the price back up like a SpaceX rocket launch.\\nGreat casting and reporting!', 'Hi Rob, please remember what the Chinese philosopher Confuscious', 'The price is 24⁄.

Is this why you exercised your options and then sold the shares?', 'Here’s my theory on why Tesla’s price didn’t go up above $695 despite the closing cross imbalance of 12M shares. \\n\\nBackground:\\nThere were many TSLA calls expiring at the end of the day yesterday (12/18). The sellers of TSLA calls had a lot to lose if there was a huge spike (especially to 700+) during the closing cross. The potential closing cross volatility also complicated delta hedging. TSLA call sellers during the day can try to manipulate the market to keep the stock price down by selling TSLA shares.\\n\\nMy theory:\\nTSLA call sellers decided to also manipulate the market to keep the stock price down during the closing cross, but this time with buy orders instead of sell orders. This sounds counter-intuitive because usually downward manipulation is done with sell orders. Buy orders usually provide an upward force on the stock price.\\n\\nGiven how the closing cross process works, I believe the price can artificially be kept down with specific limit on close (LOC) buy orders. For example, call sellers could have put in a LOC buy order for 15M shares with limit price of $695. At this price, we saw an imbalance of 12M shares. If the NASDAQ tried to increase the price above $695, the 15M shares from that LOC order would now be imbalanced. The goal of the closing cross is to minimize imbalance, so the price would stay at $695.\\n\\nIn reality, I think the call sellers LOC buy order would have been more complex. I used 15M shares at a limit of $695 for simplicity.\\n\\nI’m new to all this closing cross stuff, so I definitely could be wrong.', 'I think we are all expecting TSLA share prices to rise on S and P inclusion but can anyone explain why the share price droped  ($636 ~ -3%) shortly before this?  Why would you sell shortly before this event?  Seems a bit fishy.  Also did anyone elese notice that the share price is currently 695.00 and written backwards gives you the day change: (00)5.96% chances of that is 1/100 000.', \"You're lucky you were able to exercise and sell your shares after hours.

If it were just a result of an algorithm, the chance is 1 out of a 100 that it lands on an even dollar. I find more plausible that there was a human-in-the-loop. Nasdaq people were probably sweating over the system paring all the closing orders and were worried that the system crashes or that the price flies out of control, if it's left only for the computer algorithms to pair the closing orders. It's possible that during the last 5 minutes they looked at the closing order data, which was probably unbalanced and had more buyers than sellers,  and then decided manually to set it at 695.00 to prevent an infinity squeeze or something of the like.

This is the thing that’s actually most important in the long run I think, just from a company standpoint\".

And I think it\\'s a well known fact that the biggest thing holding back space exploration is the cost of getting off the planet, and that in-space-building will be the only way to go once we get a functioning space economy, so I just see this perfect marriage between SpaceX and Tesla in that future.

The Lupe was my neopet. Lol', 'As for the Robo taxi and door dash. Almost every video I have watched on this topic says that Tesla can and will just crush uber, lyft, DoorDash type of company’s. And I really don’t understand this point of view. Either Uber and/or it drivers, would just be able to buy a Tesla with FSD and put it to work. Tesla could try and squash the company’s and drive them out of business, but I don’t think that is what Elon will do. 1) remember his mission statement, to get to carbon neutral as fast as possible. So if we get there faster by the largest robo taxi network possible, he won’t crush them like a bug. 2) Tesla will have to start being careful about talks of being broken up. So allowing these company’s to be competition crests a stronger market and lowers the chances of that happening. 3) if Tesla launches their own robo taxi network, which I strongly believe they will, it’s just software, and that’s one of the things they do best!. They would be able to make a higher profit margin against Uber/lyft/DoorDash, until they can get their entire network of cars/drivers to EV’s with FSD. It cost about $2 a mile to ride in an Uber. So if Tesla can do it for .50 cents, they could charge say 1.75 and make crazy margins! 4) there is a crazy limit on supply of these vehicles right now. Tesla will only be able to devote a certain % of their cars to the robo network. Of course people that own a Tesla could put their car on the network as well. But not everyone is gonna want people in their personal vehicles, puking and damaging their cars. 5) we still have to wait for regulation. And I think the legacy automakers and googles, who are currently behind in FSD tech, and going to put all of their lobbying power to slow down the regulation while they try and catch up. Don’t mean it will work, and they will be successful in delaying, but this will be a factor to consider. Would love to hear y’all’s feedback on this. Many of these point might be wrong, but this could be a really cool video “the path to the global robo taxi network”', 'The grocery stores already bring the food to your car. Same with restaurants, the business will create the solution, not Tesla. As for apartments.

Personally I think Tesla already has plans for every GWH of battery they can produce. I think The energy storage business will be the most profitable thing Tesla does. And they will divorce every battery resource possible to that part of the business. They amount of money they can make with battery storage with their auto bidder software running on top of it is being totally undervalued in my opinion. It’s like combining a power plant and energy trading company into a single platform, with almost 0 operating cost. Also, the way most RV’s are made today, you buy the chassis from someone and the RV company’s build on top of it. I think an electric RV will be based on a platform from someone like Arrival. Who is going to make busses for mass transit. I don’t see many RV company’s desire to get into the Chassis manufacturing business. I could be wrong here though. But can’t wait for the first ERV!

I think this is what Goldman made their price target based on. The constraining factor the the entire EV market production growing to meet demand batteries cell production. This will be the driving factor to the EV market growth. Every manufacturer pre-selling new EV models is sold out for 100% of their 21 vehicles. They can’t produce any more even if they wanted too.

The delivery driver gets a QR code that allows them to open the delivery slot, no reason a robot can't talk with the delivery slot that it has a package and that it needs to open up. (In luxury homes you already see that they have separate slots for perishables and everything else) For places where you don't have delivery slots, local pickup is doing really well in Europe with most towns having one or two pickup places that you are able to get to within 5 to 10 min.

I have had a different path than you, I started with a Mule BMW 1 series that had all the I-3 hardware in it (after BMW had tried the hardware in a Morris minor).  I drove the Mule for two years from 2010 to 2012 and loved it.  Now a determined Electric car fan I assumed I would buy an i-3 when it became available.  To my amazement the i-3 had the same rang as the mule (100 Miles).   I planed to drive to and from Palm Springs from my Northridge home (old Parents) about 150 miles.  So the only choice I had was a Tesla Model S P85+ (not essential) with enough range (250 Miles).  After driving the Tesla I was so impressed I became a Tesla fan boy.  I know I I’ve  sold at least 6 Teslas to friends and relatives so far (didn’t give them my REF#).  In 2018 I bought a model 3hp and found it even better than the 2014 Model S I had.  Only then did I think about buying stock with my IRA account.  I bought a little at $36(adjusted) when it dipped to $180 and then over the next 4 months I put in a total of $376.000 into Tesla.  After all that and a little more since I find the value of my Tesla stock at $5,467,234.  I am blown away.

Some YouTube channels and news reports ignored these points that were raised. \\nStock holders proposals, these are points that stock holders want Tesla to address. Tesla was opposed to all of the following proposals. Which was very Donald Trump, AKA dictatorship like in their thinking, in my opinion.\\nThe first Stock holder proposal came from Mr McRichy.\\nComplaints were as follows..\\n1. Board members can only be removed if involved in criminal activity.\\n2. Individual directors can only be held accountable every three years!\\n3. The democratic way of voting must not be involved in the corporate governance of decision because as it stands, 33% of votes can win against 67% of opposition.\\nStock holder Dr Kelly Hall\\nAddressed the lack of arbitration in Tesla, in other words employees do not have the right to complain about the following.\\n1. Discrimination / race and gender\\n2. Harassment \\nShe further states that Tesla are working unlawfully and against the civil rights act of 1964.\\nShe further names the Buffalo and Freemont plants as being the worst offenders.\\nStock holder Mr Terrence Colinsworth \\nStated the following objections \\nRegarding human rights disclosure.\\nHe states five current violations of human rights.\\n1. Racism sexual harassment \\n2. Covid 19 protection is not only notvbeing addressed, but workers are facing retaliation from management when they ask for adequate protection.\\n3. Serious and deadly issues on in Tesla,s global supply chains.\\n4. Terry staes his organisation is currently  bringing a law suit against Tesla for mining Colbolt mining in the democratic Republic of Congofor using child labour, Terry further states that he had met the children that were mining there, these boys had lost arms and legs during mine shaft collapses.\\nThis goes against Teslas code of conduct. Tesla is not only tolerating child labour in its Coblot supply chain but is tolerating the death and maiming of young child miners, this demonstrates why the company must circle back and begin a process to report on its treatment of human rights issues as requested in this proposal.\\nEssentially Terry is asking for Teslar to do as they said they would in their human rights disclosure documents, which Tesla have not only written a false statement, but lied to their clients and share holders.\\nMy point is if Tesla have lied about this then who knows what else they have lied about. This to me undermines the good work that some the employees and management have done, it further undermines and makes fools of its client base, and shareholders. \\nI am disappointed that these stock holder felt the need to have these points addressed at all, and for me these points dominated the whole event!
